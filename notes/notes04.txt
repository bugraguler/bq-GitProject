pwd
cd
ls
 than-------

 Command 01 -
 git init: initialize a repo.

 *****stage architecture:
 1.Working directory : all the files that you have in your project inside this
 2.Staging area : An area between repo and working directory here the snapshot of all the files are moved before actually
 moving them to repo.
 3.Repository : our actual storing area

 Command 02 -
 git status : tells the status of repo,
 .untracked files -also tells which is not in staging area
 also tells.files that are in staging area but not in repo yet!
 .it doesnt tell us about files in staging area which are also in repo!

 .untracked --> apperars in red
 .tracked --the one in staging area appears in green color

Command 03 -
git add .
adds everything to the staging area

git add filename
adds the specific file

Command 04 -
git commit -m "commit here"
sends everything in the staging area to the repo

GitHub:
For each local repo you must have individual repo

1.Create a new remote repo.
2.On your terminal git remote  -v to check for any connections(if empty shows no connections yet)
3.git remote add origin url
4.git brach -M main (naming your branch)

you need to do these steps if you dont change your repo

5.git push -u origin main -->use is first time only
6.after that u can do git push only

7.git log shows all the commits in local repo*
Head main--> points to the latest commit that presents in your working directory.
origin main --> points to the commit in your local repo uptil which your remote repo is syncronised

extra git commands:
1.git ls-files:
show u the files that are present in the staging area.

*you can not override a file in staging area. git is going to tell that u already have some
changes in your staging area that needs to be in the repo.

2.git rm --cached filename:
removes file form staging area

3.git diff:
shows u the difference between the files in working directory and the staging area!!

4.git diff --cached:
shows u the difference between the files in repo and the staging area!!

5.git restore .
to move your files from staging area to working directory

.gitignore file
helps u ignore the files/folders that u dont want to track
remember !! if u are already tracking  that file/folder , .gitignore will not ignore it
thats why if u want to ignore a file/folder do it at the very start, before adding that folder in staging area

1. touch .gitignore
2. open this file add the name of the file or folder u want to ignore
3 save the .gitignore(txt) file
you will not see it anymore in git status

to get code from a remote repo:
1.clone
2.download zip

-the difference is that if u download the code u just download the latest commit that is there but when
u clone it, it download whole repo along with that.(all previous commits are also included).
-if u clone u can update the repo using git commanda
-if u download u cant update the repo!

git clone:
git clone URL
make sure the url is "HTTPS" not "SSH" .
